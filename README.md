# RiffleShuffle
This program returns the probability of a card 'j' appearing before another card 'i' in a deck after a simulated number of shuffles.
In order to run this program, you must choose a number of cards, shuffles, which cards you would like to test for, and the style of shuffling.
You can choose between two styles of shuffling: GSR (following the Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds Model of shuffling) and TTR (top-to-random shufflling)
type 'gsr' or 'ttr' in order to choose between the two.
